- What are you working on?

	We are working on creating a language based completely on slang terms (it will all be appropriate).

	Java

- What have you done so far? Did you meet your expectations for this week yet?

	So far we have been brainstorming key words from slang that will be used within the language.

- What do you hope to accomplish by next week? How? (Who’s doing what, if this is a team?)

	Begin coding and get the basic structure of the language designed.

- What do you need to move forward?

	Motivation, coffee, more hours in the day.
